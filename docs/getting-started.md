## Getting Started

Install `yeoman` and `generator-salsa`:
  ```
  npm install -g yo generator-salsa
  ```

Make a new directory, and `cd` into it:
  ```
  mkdir my-new-project && cd $_
  ```

Run `yo salsa`, optionally passing any options, and/or an app name:
  ```
  yo salsa [options] [app-name]
  ```
